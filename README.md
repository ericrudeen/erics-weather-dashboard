# erics-weather-dashboard

This week's assignment was to make a weather dashboard from scratch. We needed to pull from two API links from the Open Source weather database, openweathermap.org. We we're able to get the city name of the search term from their relative latitude and longitute, and the weather from each the city from another link. 

This definately required a lot of office hours and extra studying and asking for hekp from my peers but I was able to figure most of it out eventually. It was really interesting to find out exatly how fetching data from APIs works, and all the possibilities there are. 

This was the Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
